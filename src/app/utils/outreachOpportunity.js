/**
 * What a prospect's audit score means to whoever is deciding who to write to.
 *
 * The score is Google's mobile performance figure for the business's own site,
 * 0 to 100, where 100 is a fast site. Read as site health, 100 is the best
 * number on the page. Read as a sales list it is the other way round: a slow
 * site is a business with a problem worth a message, and a fast site is a
 * business with nothing to fix. So the bands here are named for the
 * opportunity rather than for the site, and the worst score is the strongest
 * lead.
 *
 * The cut points are Google's own banding of that score: 0 to 49 is a slow
 * site, 50 to 89 a middling one, 90 to 100 a fast one. Keeping them means a
 * figure that reads red in PageSpeed reads as a strong lead here, which is the
 * same fact stated for the other reader.
 *
 * A business whose only web presence is a profile on someone else's platform
 * carries no score and never will, because there is no site of its own to
 * measure. It has no site at all, which makes it the strongest lead on the
 * list, so it ranks ahead of every scored business rather than falling in with
 * the rows nothing has been measured on yet.
