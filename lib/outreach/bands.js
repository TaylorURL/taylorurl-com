 * What a PageSpeed score means, said the same way wherever it is said.

 * scale, and the sentence beside it is the part that survives the number
 * moving: a report run twice comes back a few points apart and lands in the
 * same band both times, which is why the band is what anything here argues
 * from.
 *
 * The three band names are keys elsewhere — the message's own palette is keyed
 * on them — so they are strings rather than an ordering, and `plain` is the
 * fourth for a reading that has no number in it at all.
