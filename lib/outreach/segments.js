/**
 * Which of the pipeline's conversations a prospect belongs in.
 *
 * Every message the sender writes opens on a reading of the business's site,
 * and there are only a few readings a site can come to: there is no site of
 * the business's own, the site is slow, it is middling, it is sound, or nothing
 * has been read at all. The segment is that reading given one name, so the code
 * that chooses a message and the console that says which message a business
 * would get are looking at the same word rather than each arriving at their
 * own.
 *
 * It is worked out rather than stored. Both halves of the answer already exist:
 * `hasNoSiteOfItsOwn` says whether there is a site to measure, and `opportunityBand`
 * says what the measurement came to. A column holding a copy would be a second
 * answer, and one that drifts the moment a score is retaken, so this reads those
 * two and nothing else. A business with no site of its own is `no-site`
 * whatever number a platform page happened to be given, because a score on a
 * Facebook page is a fact about Facebook.
 *
 * Strings and pure functions only. The console's build imports this beside
 * `src/app/utils/outreachOpportunity.js`, and a server dependency here would
 * break that bundle.
