/**
 * Where a prospect falls in the send queue, settled once for everything that asks.
 *
 * The queue is an ordering before it is anything else, and two separate pieces of
 * code lean on that ordering: the comparator that sorts a batch, and the read that
 * decides which rows are in the batch at all. Those two have to agree completely,
 * and the way they fail when they do not is silent. If the read treats a business
 * with no site of its own as ordinary while the comparator treats it as the
 * strongest lead on the table, the read hands over a page of rows that does not
 * contain it and the comparator never gets the chance to put it first. Nothing
 * looks wrong from outside: the queue is full, the send job runs, every message
 * goes out, and the leads worth writing to first were never among the rows anybody
 * looked at. A truncated read reads exactly like a healthy one.
 *
 * So the axis lives here rather than as an expression inside lib/outreach/sending/queue.js.
 * A comparator written inline becomes a second opinion the moment the read beside
 * it is edited without it, and the two get edited for different reasons - one when
 * the reasons for ranking a lead change, the other when the table grows and the
 * read has to be paged or bounded. Holding the whole axis in one module means an
 * edit moves both, and `ranksAhead` is derived from `rankOf` rather than restated,
 * so a row cannot be promoted by one and dropped by the other.
 *
 * Lower is stronger, which is the direction the audit score already runs in: the
 * scored sites keep their own numbers, 0 to 100 worst first, and everything that
 * beats a score is negative. A business that asked leads, because somebody who ran
 * the speed check on their own site named the problem themselves at the moment it
 * was on their mind, and no cold reading of a listing is worth as much as that. A
 * listing that reads as young comes next, since a business that has not been
 * trading long is deciding what to buy rather than defending what it already has.
 * A business with no site of its own follows, because there is nothing there to
 * argue with. Then the measured sites at their own scores, and last the rows
 * nothing has been measured on, which are unknown rather than weak and belong at
 * the end rather than scattered through the scored ones at a number they were
 * never given.
 *
 * Constants and pure functions only. Nothing here reads the database, the clock
 * or the environment, because the console bundles this beside the table it draws
 * and a server dependency would break that build.

 * The candidate read is what needs the question. It orders on `audit_score`,
