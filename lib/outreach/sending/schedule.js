 * hearing from the studio at 09:12 and another at 14:40 are two people who
 * were written to, rather than two rows of one list processed in a minute.
 * Five messages leaving in the same second share a timestamp, and a shared
 * timestamp is the thing a filter reads first.
 *
 * Slots sit at the middle of equal divisions of the window, so the padding at
 * the start and the end matches and the last message never lands against
 * closing time. Each is then moved by an amount decided by the date and its own
 * position, which varies the gaps without changing what they average and
 * without moving once the day has started: the schedule has to be the same
 * answer at 08:05 and at 16:55, because every run of the job recomputes it.
 *
 * Nothing here reads a clock of its own. The caller passes the moment, which is
 * what lets a whole day be walked through in a test.
