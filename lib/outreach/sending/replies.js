/**
 * What an inbound reply asks for, out of the words its sender actually typed.
 *
 * The outbound message tells the recipient to reply and say so, which makes
 * the reply the opt-out channel and its text the only record of the request.
 * CAN-SPAM allows ten business days to honour one and no allowance at all for
 * one that arrived, was filed and was never acted on, so the reading happens
 * here and the suppression that follows it happens without a person in the
 * middle.
 *
 * Only new text is tested. A mail client answers by quoting the message it is
 * answering, and the quoted copy carries the outbound footer offering the
 * opt-out, so a warm reply that quotes the message whole reads as a request to
 * stop unless the quoted part is cut first. Two cuts take it: lines a client
 * marked with '>', and everything from the attribution line a client writes
 * above the copy it quotes.
 *
 * A reply written underneath the quoted copy leaves nothing above that
 * attribution. Cutting there answers with an empty string and therefore no
 * opt-out at all, so the whole body with its marked lines removed is tested
 * instead. Reading one quoted opt-out as a real one costs a single prospect;
 * missing a real one is a violation, and the two are not the same size.
