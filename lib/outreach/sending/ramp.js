/**
 * Where the day's sending cap goes next.
 *
 * A ceiling reached by somebody raising a number every morning is a ceiling
 * never reached, and a ramp nobody holds is a sending domain burned on the
 * morning nobody looked. So the cap climbs on its own while the trailing
 * bounce rate stays clean, stands still while anything is marginal, and comes
 * back down and stops when the rate breaches.
 *
 * The decision is here rather than in the route because it is arithmetic over
 * four numbers and a date, and arithmetic that decides how much mail leaves a
 * domain should be readable without a database in front of it. The route reads
 * the settings row and the bounce record, hands both to `decide`, and writes
 * back whatever comes out.
 *
 * Three things bound the climb and they are not the same thing:
 *
 *   DAILY_CAP_MAX     what the mailbox can carry, which the column enforces
 *   RAMP_BLIND_MAX    how far the evidence available here reaches
 *   ramp_floor        the highest cap this ramp has watched a clean day at
 *
 * The first two are constants and the third is written as the ramp goes, which
 * is what gives a rollback somewhere honest to roll back to.
 *
 * ## The day whose numbers are not yet in
 *
 * Today is never read. It is incomplete by construction at any hour the job
 * could fire, and a partial day of sending against a full day of bounces is a
 * rate that flatters. Excluding it by date rather than by trusting the cron
 * means a run started by hand at noon reads the same days as the scheduled one
 * before dawn.
 *
 * A closed day's notices are in: hard bounces come back at the transport or as
 * a DSN, api/outreach/watch.js reads the mailbox hourly, and the last send of a
 * day is fifteen hours before the ramp looks at it.
 *
 * ## The complaint half
 *
 * There is no complaint rate and there is no way to get one. Gmail SMTP runs no
 * feedback loop, so a reader marking a cold message as spam tells Google and
 * tells this side nothing; outreach_messages has no column for it and nothing
 * writes one. Google Postmaster Tools is the only route and it is not set up.
 *
 * So the ramp does not pretend to check one. It climbs to RAMP_BLIND_MAX, which
 * is as far as hard bounces alone can justify, and stops there saying why. The
 * range above that is decided by sender reputation rather than by list quality,
 * and reputation is the half with no reading behind it.
