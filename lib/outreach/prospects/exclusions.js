/**
 * The businesses cold outreach does not write to.

 * Five rules live in one file because all five answer the same question at
 * the same moment: whether a row off a map search is a business that can hire
 * a studio this size. A brand list and a domain count between them catch
 * national franchises; a category list catches the organisations that cannot
 * buy from one at all; a size list catches the companies with a department
 * between the website and anybody who could say yes; and a held list carries
 * the domains a person has decided are not to be written to, whatever the
 * listing says. A host list in lib/outreach/prospects/platforms.js catches a listing
 * whose website belongs to a platform rather than to the business, and is
 * re-exported here so the rules read as one set.
 *
 * Every rule marks a row and none removes one. A prospect skipped this week is
 * found again next week under the same place id, and the sourcing job rewrites
 * a row's details without touching its stage, so a skipped row stays skipped
 * rather than being weighed again from nothing.

 * National franchises, grouped by the trade each brand operates in.
 *
 * A franchise location has its website, its brand and its marketing settled at
 * a head office in another state. Nobody at the local number can commission a
 * site, so a message to one is spend against an answer that cannot arrive.
 *
 * A name counts as a franchise only where the prospect's trade agrees with the
 * group the brand sits in. 'Midas' filed under auto repair is a franchise and
 * 'Midas Touch Cleaning' is a cleaning company, and the two are the same
 * string; a haircut brand inside a plumber's name is a coincidence at the
 * level of the words. The trade is what separates them, and a brand ambiguous
 * enough that no group holds it falls to the domain count, which needs no list
 * and cares nothing for what a business calls itself.
 *
 * The host is read without the trade. A franchise domain belongs to the
 * franchise whatever a listing filed the location under.
 *
 * A group grows by one more name in its brands, or one more term in the trades
 * that reach it.
