/**
 * Businesses just sued in federal court over their website's accessibility,
 * read off CourtListener's copy of the federal dockets.
 *
 * A suit like this is filed by a blind plaintiff whose screen reader could not
 * use the defendant's site, under nature of suit 446 (Americans with
 * Disabilities - Other). What it leaves the defendant with is a site that has
 * to be brought up to WCAG 2.1 AA, usually on a deadline a settlement sets,
 * which makes a business in that position one that is buying a fix from
 * somebody this month.
 *
 * The search endpoint answers without a token, and it reaches into the text of
 * a complaint wherever the RECAP archive holds one. That is what both reads
 * here lean on. The first asks for 446 suits whose complaint talks about a
 * screen reader and a website, which is the line between a website suit and
 * the far larger number filed over a ramp or a restroom. The second asks one
 * docket for the part of its complaint that names the site, and the snippet
 * that comes back carries the address: "Because Defendant's interactive
 * website, www.example.com, including all portions thereof".
 *
 * A suit whose complaint the archive does not hold matches neither read, so
 * the source only ever files a business whose website the complaint named.
 *
 * Strings and pure functions only, apart from the one fetch helper the job
 * hands in, so the check can read every rule here without the network.
