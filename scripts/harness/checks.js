/**
 * The runner every check under scripts/ reports through.
 *
 * A check is a sentence and whatever decides it. A function is a case: `finish`
 * calls it later, in the order it was checked, and the first assertion to throw
 * inside it is its failure. Anything else is decided where it stands, which is
 * how a check walking a table or a tree says what held at each row without
 * stopping at the first that did not.
 *
 * A failure is printed the moment it is known and the run carries on, so one
 * pass reports every fault rather than the first. `finish` then ends the process
 * non-zero if anything failed, which is what `npm test` stops on, so the
 * sentence a script closes on is only ever printed by a run in which everything
 * held.
